READ ME - Ramesh Kalagnanam - Web Development

I would like to provide a few notes about the HTML and other files I have submitted as follows:

1. I requested Lisa Shemancik to give me an extension of two days and she was kind enough to grant my request.
   I conveyed this to Michael Dinh as well as Bowen during the class on Saturday, August 10, 2019.
   
2. I realize that some aspects deviate slightly from the example given but I am hoping that we are allowed to 
   exercise some level of discretion in the choices for formatting.
   
3. I would like to acknowledge direction given to me for different aspects of the homework by Divya. I consulted with
   her quite a bit to understand HTML and Bootstrap. I also appreciate the help given by Michael, Bowen as well as my tutor,
   Chris Richardson. I believe these interactions enriched me and helped me understand the nuances.
